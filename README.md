# ARC

  Project Title: ARC (Architectural Research Collaborative)

Description: ARC is a high-performance digital platform designed to translate the physical weight of modern architecture into a weightless, immersive web experience. Built on a "Digital Brutalist" philosophy, the interface strips away decorative elements to focus purely on structure, grid, and typography. The aesthetic is defined by a stark, void-black canvas (#000000) dissected by clinical white grid lines and punctuated by high-visibility "Acid Lime" (#C4F240) accents, creating a visual language that feels more like a technical blueprint than a traditional website.

Key Features:

Split-Screen Framework: A non-traditional homepage that divides the viewport into "Atmosphere" (visual mood) and "Utility" (navigational archive), allowing users to explore the studio's ethos without losing context.
Bento Grid Architecture: A dynamic project index that uses a modular layout system to vary the visual weight of case studies, seamlessly adapting from complex desktop grids to fluid mobile streams.
Structural Typography: Utilizing massive, tight-tracking type (Inter Tight) that acts as architectural form, contrasted with monospaced data fonts (JetBrains Mono) for wayfinding and technical metadata.
Physics-Based Interaction: Powered by Motion (formerly Framer Motion), the site features smooth parallax scrolling, magnetic hover states, and zero-layout-shift transitions that make the digital environment feel tactile and responsive.
Meta-Documentation: Includes a self-referential "Case Study" module that documents the site's own design process, turning the code itself into a portfolio piece.
